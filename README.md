# Employee Tracker

This challenge is for module 12 of UMO coding bootcamp.

## Description

This application allows the user to view and manage employees in a database.

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to utilize all of the knowledge we have gained from being introduced to mysql and connecting to the databases we create with node.js.

## Installation

Download/clone repository and run "npm install" from the terminal in the root folder.

## Usage

Once "npm install" has been ran, run index.js by typing "node index.js" to have the database application started. The user will be greeted with a variety of options to aid them in managing and viewing the employees of the business they are working at. When finished, ctrl+c can be used to exit the program.
